## AKIOI-2048

It's a code written in C++, just as [ak-ioi.com/apps/oi-2048/](https://ak-ioi.com/apps/oi-2048/), but you can only use it on Windows, because the ```windows.h``` file can not be used on MacOS or Linux.

### How to use it

There're levels of CE, RE, TLE, MLE, ILE, OLE, UKE, WA, SJE, PC, AC, AU, AK. For addtionally, there's also O2 and O3 for x2 and x4 (this is a very useful way to reach high level or points).

Use W, A, S, D to control in the game.

If you want to read the help menu, press M continuenessly.

Reach high points and reach AK! Good Luck!
